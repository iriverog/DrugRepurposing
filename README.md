## Abstract


The one drug-one gene-one disease paradigm that has traditionally guided drug
design has proven to be successful in some scenarios. Yet, different therapeutic
strategies such as polypharmacology and drug repurposing can be better applied
in the light of the functional interactome, which maps how proteins physically
and functionally interact with one another. Moreover, this interconnectedness
suggests that diseases are caused by perturbations in a densely connected group
of genes termed “disease module”. In order to take the most out of therapeutic
strategies, a holistic quantification of the polypharmacological properties and
drug repurposing opportunities offered by approved drugs is needed. In this
study we conduct a network-based analysis of 985 FDA-approved drugs to quantify
their polypharmacological properties, in terms of direct and extended target
genes, as well as their potential to cover a set of 176 diseases and their
modules. Our results suggest that drug repurposing can offer a 10-fold increase
in disease treatment, that disease modules can be used to understand and design
new therapeutic strategies with potentially higher efficacy and that drugs’
mechanisms of action should be more thoroughly analyzed to increase drugs’
applicability.
